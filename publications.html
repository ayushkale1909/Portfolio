<h2>Classification of Japanese Papers based on deep learning of optical coherence tomography images</h2> 
<br>
<p>Classification of Kozo-Fibered Papers Made in Japan Based on Deep Learning of Optical Coherence Tomography Images (JTu2A.39), CLEO, Applications and Technology, May 9, 2023, Optica
</p><br>
<p>In this study, we performed optical coherence tomography (OCT) classification on
Japanese paper samples. We trained and validated the Alex-Net and Res-Net to classify the paper
samples based on their OCT cross-section images. Our results demonstrated that both Alex-Net
and Res-Net can be used to assist conservators to classify Japanese papers with high accuracy.</p>

<h2>OPTIMISATION OF PULSE FORMING NETWORKS</h2><br> 
<br>
<p>IJRDO Journal of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (ISSN: 2456-6055)  July 15, 2021</p><br> 
<p>This article presents reliable optimization techniques to improve the pulse generated by the PulseFormingNetworks (PFN) for high energy efficiency. The shape generated by PFN is not ideal however PFNs can be designedwithbetterpulse performance by doing modifications and using techniques which can improve the desired output pulse shape andoverallenergy efficiency of the network. In this study, two novel techniques have been discussed. Particle SwarmOptimization(PSO)algorithm, proposed by Kennedy & Eberhart, a metaheuristic algorithm has been used to calculate the exact values of PFNwithvariable inductors which would tune PFN to generate the pulses with high energy efficiency. Greenâ€™s Functionapproachdeveloped by Carl Neumann has been used to calculate the compensating voltage which can be used to compensatefortheripples, overshoot, rise time, fall time, etc. to improve the overall pulse performance. Using these optimization techniques, theenergy efficiency of the network can be improved to a great extent. Both the techniques are validated using MATLAB/Simulinkmodels.
